# 42RoboLab - Hardware Piscine
A one week intensive course to develop a working 2D and 3D API for solid modeling.  Using Onshape's in-house programming language, Featurescript, parts were designed within parametric standards.

## API:
   * [2D](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/937545479d56780f57c907dc/w/889edb79cb60ba7ac82416d5/e/2f0649118e67d02ee5240aad)
       * Draws a clover emblem that can be placed onto any flat plane or face.  Includes a built-in
       3D extrude tool.  Otherwise, a 2D figure is sketched out.

   * [3D - Wedge](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/cce318e753f8c4b75c7669de/w/6a272cb8770562b36c794300/e/b4d920ed6ee797d30feaea06)
       * Generates a wedge with an inner triangular piece.  Can vary the extrusion depth, and height/width of the triangles separately.

   * [LEGO - Includes Logo](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/df635ee368f6edab06b6662d/w/ba6982468e7fdae542cadf5a/e/ec1f111f122f39ea2600797f)
    
       * LEGO piece with changeable width and length.  Part auto-adjusts for post or cylinder underneath.
       Will generate a post with any 1 x Z LEGO (where Z is an integer >= 2), and a cylinder with any
       2 x Z LEGO (where Z is an integer >= 2).
