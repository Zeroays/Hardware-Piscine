# 42RoboLab - Hardware Piscine
A one week intensive course to develop a working 2D and 3D API for solid modeling.  Using Onshape's in-house program, Featurescript, parts were designed within parametric standards.

## API:
   * [2D](www.google.com)
       * Draws a clover emblem that can be placed onto any flat plane or face.  Includes a built-in
       3D extrude tool.  Otherwise, a 2D figure is sketched out.
        
   * [3D - Wedge](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a41dfa6250065e54b465207c/w/793852063b24e68979f7a476/e/684a2ea7e1b8397036a398f2)
       * Generates a wedge with an inner triangular piece.  Can vary the extrusion depth, and height/width of the triangles separately.
        
   * [LEGO - Includes Logo](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6e5ec1c3ef88c1701d50ed6c/w/f0399a93485f60371ffb2db5/e/c6a1a5ac96c336cba4e311cf)
    
       * LEGO piece with changeable width and length.  Part auto-adjusts for post or cylinder underneath.
       Will generate a post with any 1 x Z LEGO (where Z is an integer >= 2), and a cylinder with any
       2 x Z LEGO (where Z is an integer >= 2).
